## Deploy changes

Netlify automatically deploys new changes commited to `main` on GitHub. If you want to change deployment branch, do so in [build & deploy settings on Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/#branches-deploys).

## Front-end file structure
- `_data`: fetches the data from Sanity
- `_includes`: templates for components and pages, also include the CSS
- `assets`: contains all the fonts
- Files containing HTML end with `.njk`.

### Animation
The animation of the front page can be found in `_includes/components`.
- `homeAnimation.njk`
- `homeAnimation.css`

Make sure to keep the following code at the end of `homeAnimation.njk` (it inserts the CSS file):
```
{% set css %}
    {% include "components/homeAnimation.css" %}
{% endset %}
<style>
    {{ css | cssmin | safe }}
</style>
```
